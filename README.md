# CalculatorGUI
Project started Sep 21, 2023 @ 3:00 PM CST
Note: I did not build this from scratch, I followed the tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhV1ZEVNK08&list=PLJ9GeMZoIma5UCFFehlPatmpBXmIqrVJE&index=1
Qt Calculator GUI Tutorial Part 1-5
Channel name:Programming Liftoff
In this tutorial I learned about connectors, what conditions to set when attempting to type a decimal number ex: 0.00001, fixing numbers becoming scientific notation after x amount of digits, and using booleans for when the unary operators have been pressed

This is a calculator program I created using QT Creator. The calculator serves to understand how a standard calculator work and implementing standard operators. (+.-./,X) It can also add decimal numbers
Features I implemented:
Sep 22,2023 Backspace functionality, device numpad functionality
Bugs fixed : Display going to 0 if backspace pressed when a single digit is displayed.
